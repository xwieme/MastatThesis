\section{Data set description}

The same data set as Wu et. al is used which is part of the publicly available 
benchmark data sets of MoleculeNet.\cite{wu2018moleculenet} This data set contains 
the measured solubility at $25^{\circ} C$ in $log(mol/L)$ for $1111$ compounds when duplicates 
are removed. Molecules are represented as a string using the simple molecular 
line entry system \big(SMILES\big).\cite{weininger1988smiles} Another representation 
of molecules is a graph where the atoms represent the nodes and the bonds represent 
the edges. Molecular graphs can be generated from SMILES using the python package 
rdkit (\cref{fig:smiles_and_graphs}).\cite{landrum2010r}
