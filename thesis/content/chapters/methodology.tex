\section{Data set description}

The same data set as Wu et. al is used which is part of the publicly available 
benchmark data sets of MoleculeNet.\cite{wu2018moleculenet} This data set contains 
the measured solubility at $25^{\circ} C$ in $log(mol/L)$ for $1110$ compounds when duplicates 
are removed. Molecules are represented as a string using the simple molecular 
line entry system \big(SMILES\big).\cite{weininger1988smiles} 





\section{Architecture of the graph neural network model to predict water solubility}


Prediction of water solubility is achieved using the same RGCN model as Wu et. al.,
with the hyper parameters listed in \cref{tab:hyperparameters}. To obtain more 
robust predictions, ten models are trained, each with a different seed 
$(2023 + 10i, \text{ with } i \in \{1, 2, \dots, 10\})$, where the final 
prediction is then obtained by the average prediction over all models.
