% Here you fill in your acknowledgements
I would like to thank professor dr. Yvan Saeys and drs. Arne Gevaert for allowing me 
to pursue my master thesis inside the Data Mining and Modelling for Biomedicine group. 
They were always there for me when I needed them, in addition to their wise remarks and 
recommendations. I am grateful to dr. Guillaume Acke for his suggestions regarding the chemical 
application. Finally, I want to express my appreciation to my family for all of their 
support and assistance.
