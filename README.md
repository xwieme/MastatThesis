## Descirption 

Currently, machine learning is applied in various disciplines of science. For example, in chemistry, the application
of machine learning is used to predict molecular properties, generate synthesis routes and explore the chemical space
to discover novel molecules with preferred properties. Due to the inherent graph nature of molecules, graph neural networks
(GNN) are state of the art machine learning models that obtain a lot of attention. However, the explainability of GNN models
is stil a challenge. This lack of explainablility makes it difficult to get insight into how the model cam up with its prediction.
In this thesis, explainability of GNN models will be explored within the context of chemical applications.
